# Olympic Games Data Analysis

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of the [Olympic Games](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results) dataset from Kaggle. This project was carried out to answer various questions about the dataset and discover interesting findings and patterns in the Olympic Games, athletes, nations, and sports. Also, because I am a huge fan of the Olympicsâ€” India's great performances in Hockey being my inspiration!

#### Tools Used:

- **SQL**: Querying and analyzing data from the Olympic Games dataset.
- **Oracle Database**: The Database Management System utilized for storing and querying the dataset.
- **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Integrated development environment used for writing and executing the SQL queries and managing the resulting sets as CSV files. It was also used to prepare the markdown documents in this repository.
- **Lucidchart**: Creating the schema diagrams (ERDs) to visualize the structure of the Olympic Games dataset.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Graphing distributions and creating bar charts from the result sets of the SQL queries to visualize the data.

This analysis can be valuable for sports historians, data enthusiasts, and anyone interested in learning about the Olympic Games really. So read on and enjoy exploring some fascinating insights into one of the world's most celebrated sporting events!

## Database Schema

The Olympic Games dataset contains two tables: `noc_regions_sm` and `athlete_events_sm`. 

The former is a lookup table for all the countries that have taken part in the Olympics and their unique 3-letter National Olympic Committee codes, the `NOC`, which acts as the primary key for this table.

``` SQL []
DESC NOC_REGIONS_SM;
```

| Column Name | Data Type    | Nullable | Description                      |
| :---------- | :----------- | :------- | :------------------------------- |
| NOC         | CHAR(3)      | No       | National Olympic Committee code  |
| REGION      | VARCHAR(50)  | No       | Country name                     |
| NOTES       | VARCHAR(128) | No       | Additional notes for the country |

> **Note:** The `NOTES` column is for teams with more than one name, some old alias, or any other niche characteristics.

The latter is the main table that contains detailed information about athletes and their participation in the various Olympic Games. This table stores each record of a participation by an athlete, down to the specific sport and event, and what medal they won (if they did). It also documents the personal details of each athlete (e.g. name, age, weight, etc.) and the country they represented. Here, the `NOC` column is a foreign key to the previous lookup table. Finally, the `ID` column is the primary key for this table, which is used to uniquely identify each athlete that ever participated in the Olympic Games.

``` SQL []
DESC ATHLETE_EVENTS_SM;
```

| Column Name | Data Type      | Nullable | Description                             |
